          I am an aspiring web developer located in Portland, OR.
          Born and raised in California, world traveller, and front-end enthusiast.
          I have only been developing for a short while, but it is all I do these days.
          I am right in the middle of my education at Epicodus, a code school that has been instrumental in helping me get on the path to finding my place in this
           tech world. Currently, I am studying JavaScript, Ruby/Rails and a variety of other frameworks.
          All my life I have loved the feeling of creating something new. I get satisfaction from making things
          that are not only beautiful, but are fun to use. I see myself programming for the rest of my life.
          Thanks for visiting my site, and keep in touch! Come back and see me again.
